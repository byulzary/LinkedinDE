This project is in progress.
This project aims to find insights into Linkedin job postings, for example: connections between salaries and a job's location, correlations between seniority level and salaries, etc.
The project uses Python and Pandas for data ingestion and transformations.
I've used a MySQL database, but any SQL database should work with minor tweeks to the code.
For the insights, I've implemented the Linear Regression model.
I will be updating this project as I progress, including visualizing analytics and insights using Seaborn and Django/Flask for web page frontend.
